The course has two general themes: (1) fundamental concepts related to data in software engineering; (2) basic principles of database systems as seen by users, application programmers and database administrators.\nThe course introduces concepts and techniques related to working with data, information and knowledge, although the focus is mostly on data and information.\n\n", "external_links": [], "tags": ["Software Engineering", "Data", "Information", "Knowledge", "Database Systems", "Programming", "Management", "Bachelor's Programme", "Compulsory Course", "Credits"]}
