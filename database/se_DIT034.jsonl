The course has two general themes: (1) fundamental concepts related to data in software engineering; (2) basic principles of database systems as seen by users, application programmers and database administrators.\nThe course introduces concepts and techniques related to working with data, information and knowledge, although the focus is mostly on data and information. Techniques related to extraction, representation, modeling, and access , and visualization of data are discussed.\nThe course then introduces the role of databases and database management systems, covering topics such as algebra and the relational database, logical and physical design of databases, and the use of SQL.\n\n", "external_links": [], "tags": ["software engineering", "data", "information", "knowledge", "database systems", "database management", "data extraction", "data modeling", "database design", "SQL"]}
